        <h4>One ring to rule them all</h4>
            <p>Cloud tech management and in-site metal nightmare</p>
            <p>Linux containers with Docker and Kubernetes</p>
            <p>Configuration management with Puppet, Chef and (less) Ansible</p>
        <h4>Why DevOps?</h4>
            <p>DevOps joins almost everything tech I like all together</p>
