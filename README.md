# FIGAROCORSO's writings

In this repo I will store all the writings I would produce or I have already done. In the very first steps I have tried to recover articles, music reviews, blog posts... For now on, I will use this repo as a place to publish and backup all the stuff I like to write.

If you have any question, doubts about licensing, way of improvement,... whatever, do not hesitate to ask me. Or better, just pull request your changes.

## License:

If you want to use something written over here you should take into consideration that, as I use this place as a backup, in many entries you will find a link to the original source, thus please use that destination as your source and follow the license those external sites may have. If the link is broken or there isn't any link or reference to the original source you can consider a CC BY-NC-SA license.

## Technology behind this site:

* This repo is automatically built by Github rendering this [awesome place](http://figarocorso.github.io).
* That page is built using a tool to blog-like pages from static content called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
* After a quick search I found this [HMFAYSAL V2 theme](http://v2.theevilgenius.tk) which has been developed by [Hossain Mohd Faysal](http://hmfaysal.tk). Kudos for him as I think is a great theme.
* I have already done several modifications to the theme, but its backbone remains almost unchanged.
* To recover some of the writings I had already done I used several tools and some self made scripts:
    * To parse some HTML articles to Markdown I've used this [html2text](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/) script.
    * To download some articles I've used Perl module [Mechanize](http://search.cpan.org/~ether/WWW-Mechanize-1.73/)
    * I delete those scripts and others as they were trivial and quite self-cutomizated.

## What kind of articles will you find here:

They are stored under the ```_posts``` folder. I'm trying to keep then organised, but it is going to be a quite hard task, so do not blame on me.

After the initial commits you will find:
1. Personal blog posts I have written since 2009 (I've been writing since 2002... but you know...)
2. Some articles I have written for events, companies, ...
3. Short stories (I have lost tones of them, but this place will save the future ones)
4. Music reviews (again, most of them were lost)
5. My [Genbeta.com](http://www.genbeta.com) articles. I wrote them during the two great years I spent working there. They all should be online, please, link to the original source if you want to share any of them.
