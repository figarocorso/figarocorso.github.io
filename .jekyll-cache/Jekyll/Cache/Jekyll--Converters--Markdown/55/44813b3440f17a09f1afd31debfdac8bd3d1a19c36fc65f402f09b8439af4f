I"j<p><strong>Firstly some words in English</strong>
These past three days have been incredible. While I was at the train to Edinburgh I was afraid of how it would be living with “other family”. The fact is that after being with you all I just feel like I want to be in those “happy family” photos. You have made me feel like one of yours… Thank you!</p>
