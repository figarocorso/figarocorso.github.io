<p>Since my memory is able to recall I have been attached to a book or I have been involved into some kind of writing or journalism project. Maybe once I decided to jump towards a quite more technical carreer reading won the battle agains producing writings. For the future me (who else could be cusious about this?) I have collected quite a bunch of my writings inside a single place.</p>
